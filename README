# resume_tracker

Simple Ruby utility for tracking resumes submitted by recruiters.

## Origin

This utility was created to help me track resumes sent to me by recruiting
firms when we've had open technology positions.  It started life as a
command-line utility, and I've added a Ruby Shoes front-end to experiment
with Shoes.

This utility is the guinea pig for my first Github repository so that I
can start learning Git and Github.
